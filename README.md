# Knapsack Application Solver using Backtracking

This Flutter application provides a solution to the Knapsack problem using the backtracking algorithm. The Knapsack problem is a combinatorial optimization problem, which involves selecting a subset of items with given weights and values to maximize the total value without exceeding a given weight limit.

## Features

- Input fields for item weights and values
- Dynamic addition and removal of items
- Calculates the maximum value that can be carried in the knapsack
- User-friendly interface with real-time calculations
